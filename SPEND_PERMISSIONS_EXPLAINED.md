# 🔓 Auto Spend Permissions - How It Works

## Summary

**You're absolutely right!** Sub Accounts with Auto Spend Permissions should **NOT show repeated popups**. Here's how it actually works:

### Expected Behavior

✅ **First transaction**: ONE popup where user grants spend permissions  
✅ **All subsequent transactions**: NO popups - execute automatically!

---

## 🎯 How Auto Spend Permissions Work

According to the [official Base documentation](https://docs.base.org/identity/smart-wallet/guides/sub-accounts/setup#auto-spend-permissions):

### First-Time Transaction Flow

When a Sub Account attempts its **first transaction**, Base Account displays a popup for user approval. During this approval process, Base Account:

1. **Automatically detects** any missing tokens (native or ERC-20) needed for the transaction
2. **Requests a transfer** of the required funds from the parent Base Account to the Sub Account
3. **Allows the user to optionally grant ongoing spend permissions** for future transactions in that token

**This is the ONLY popup the user should see!**

### Subsequent Transactions

If the user **granted spend permissions**, future transactions follow this priority:

1. ✅ First, attempt using existing Sub Account balances and granted spend permissions
2. ✅ Execute **without any popup or user confirmation**
3. ⚠️ Only show popup if insufficient balance AND no spend permission

---

## 🔧 Current Implementation

Your app is already configured correctly:

```typescript
const sdkInstance = createBaseAccountSDK({
  appName: "Balloon Game",
  appLogoUrl: "https://base.org/logo.png",
  appChainIds: [baseSepolia.id],
  subAccounts: {
    creation: "on-connect",
    defaultAccount: "sub",
  },
});
```

**Auto Spend Permissions are ENABLED BY DEFAULT!**

---

## ❓ Why Are You Still Seeing Popups?

If you're seeing popups for **every** Pump/Bank action, here are the possible reasons:

### 1. User Hasn't Granted Spend Permissions Yet

**Solution:** On the **first pump**, the user needs to:
- ✅ Approve the transaction
- ✅ **Grant ongoing spend permissions** for ETH

Make sure the user clicks **"Approve"** or **"Grant Permission"** (not just close the popup).

### 2. SDK Version Issue

**Check your SDK version:**

```bash
npm list @base-org/account
```

Auto Spend Permissions require SDK version `2.0.2-canary.20250822164845` or later.

**To update:**

```bash
npm install @base-org/account@latest
```

### 3. Wallet Not Supporting Spend Permissions

**Requirements:**
- Must use **Coinbase Smart Wallet** or **Base Account**
- Regular wallets (MetaMask, etc.) don't support this feature

### 4. Testing on Wrong Network

Auto Spend Permissions work on:
- ✅ Base Mainnet (8453)
- ✅ Base Sepolia (84532)
- ❌ Other testnets may not support it

---

## 🧪 How to Test It Properly

### Step 1: Fresh Start

1. Clear browser storage/cookies
2. Disconnect wallet
3. Reconnect with Base Account

### Step 2: First Transaction

When you click **"💨 PUMP"** for the **first time**:

**You should see a popup like this:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Balloon Game wants to:             │
│                                     │
│  • Send 0.001 ETH to contract      │
│  • Grant spend permission for ETH  │
│                                     │
│  [ ] Grant permission for future    │
│      transactions (recommended)     │
│                                     │
│         [Cancel]  [Approve]         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Make sure to:**
- ✅ Check the box "Grant permission for future transactions"
- ✅ Click **"Approve"**

### Step 3: Subsequent Transactions

When you click **"💨 PUMP"** again:

**Expected:**
- ✅ NO popup
- ✅ Transaction executes immediately
- ✅ Status updates without user interaction

## 📊 Transaction Flow Comparison

### ❌ WITHOUT Spend Permissions (Old Way)

```
User clicks Pump → Popup → User approves → Transaction
User clicks Pump → Popup → User approves → Transaction
User clicks Pump → Popup → User approves → Transaction
```

**Result:** Annoying popup spam! 😫

### ✅ WITH Auto Spend Permissions (Current)

```
User clicks Pump → Popup + Grant Permission → Transaction
User clicks Pump → ✨ Instant transaction (no popup)
User clicks Pump → ✨ Instant transaction (no popup)
User clicks Pump → ✨ Instant transaction (no popup)
```

**Result:** Smooth gaming experience! 🎮

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Check if Spend Permission Was Granted

Add this debug code to check permission status:

```typescript
import { fetchPermissions } from "@base-org/account/spend-permission";

const checkPermissions = async () => {
  const permissions = await fetchPermissions({
    account: subAccountAddress,
    chainId: baseSepolia.id,
    spender: subAccountAddress,
    provider,
  });
  
  console.log("Active permissions:", permissions);
};
```

### Force Manual Funding (Disable Auto Spend)

If you want to test without Auto Spend Permissions:

```typescript
subAccounts: {
  creation: "on-connect",
  defaultAccount: "sub",
  funding: "manual", // Disable Auto Spend Permissions
}
```

---

## 🎮 What This Means for Your Game

### Current Setup (Correct!)

```typescript
// ✅ Your configuration is correct
subAccounts: {
  creation: "on-connect",
  defaultAccount: "sub",
}
// Auto Spend Permissions enabled by default
```

### Expected User Experience

1. **Connect Wallet** → Sub account created automatically
2. **First Pump** → User approves + grants spend permission (ONE TIME ONLY)
3. **All Future Pumps/Banks** → Execute instantly without popups! 🎈

### If Still Seeing Popups

The user likely:
- ❌ Declined the spend permission grant
- ❌ Closed the popup without approving
- ❌ Using an incompatible wallet

**Solution:** Ask them to **disconnect and reconnect**, then **grant permission** on the first transaction.

## ✅ Summary

**Your implementation is correct!** 

Auto Spend Permissions are:
- ✅ Enabled by default in your config
- ✅ Should eliminate repeated popups
- ✅ Only require ONE approval on first transaction

**If users are seeing repeated popups:**
1. They haven't granted spend permissions yet
2. They're using an incompatible wallet
3. SDK version might be outdated

**Next Steps:**
1. Update SDK to latest version
2. Test with Coinbase Smart Wallet / Base Account
3. Ensure user grants permission on first transaction
4. Enjoy popup-free gaming! 🎈🎉
