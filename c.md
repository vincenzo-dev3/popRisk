# 🎈 Contract Addresses Explained

## 📍 Address Breakdown

### ✅ **Current Contract (ETH-based) - CORRECT!**

**Address:** `0x172Aee5D51D231DBFa9C0F5E09E68237471b185c`

**Status:** ✅ **Deployed and Working!**

**Proof:**
```bash
# Has bytecode deployed
eth_getCode: 0x6080604052600436106100c15760003560e01c8063...
# This means contract EXISTS!
```

**Details:**
- Payment: Native ETH (0.001 ETH entry fee)
- Deployed: October 17, 2025
- Network: Base Sepolia (Chain ID 84532)
- Verified: ✅ Yes on Basescan
- Used by: `balloon-app/src/app/page.tsx`

### ❌ **Old Contract (USDC-based) - NOT A CONTRACT!**

**Address:** `0x0F83B96e0d7614b65347b4333Efd27dc55Df91DC`

**Status:** ❌ **NOT a contract - It's your DEPLOYER wallet!**

**Proof:**
```bash
# No bytecode - just an EOA wallet
eth_getCode: 0x
# This means it's a regular wallet, not a contract!
```

**What it actually is:**
- This is YOUR WALLET ADDRESS (Externally Owned Account)
- The address that deployed contracts
- Has private key / signer
- NOT a smart contract!

## 🔍 The Confusion

Looking at `deployments/baseSepolia.json`:

```json
{
  "deployer": "0x0F83B96e0d7614b65347b4333Efd27dc55Df91DC",  // ← Your wallet!
  "contracts": {
    "BalloonGame": "0x172Aee5D51D231DBFa9C0F5E09E68237471b185c"  // ← The contract!
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `deployer` = Your wallet (EOA) that deployed the contract
- `BalloonGame` = The actual contract address

## 📊 Verification

### **Check Contract (Current):**
```bash
curl -s "https://sepolia.base.org" \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getCode","params":["0x172Aee5D51D231DBFa9C0F5E09E68237471b185c", "latest"],"id":1}'

# Result: 0x6080604052... (thousands of characters)
# ✅ This is contract bytecode!
```

### **Check Deployer Wallet:**
```bash
curl -s "https://sepolia.base.org" \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getCode","params":["0x0F83B96e0d7614b65347b4333Efd27dc55Df91DC", "latest"],"id":1}'

# Result: 0x (empty)
# ✅ This is just a wallet, not a contract!
```
